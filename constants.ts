  "Long before the first player spawned, the world was silent.",
  "Not dead— just waiting.",
  "Buried deep beneath the overworld lay a structure older than the oceans and wiser than any kingdom that would ever rise: a forge that did not shape metal, but shaped reality.",
  "They called it the Veilforge.",
  "Legends claim it was created by an ancient order known only as The Forgers — beings who could bend the world like molten iron. Every mountain, river, and cave was not formed by nature, but forged with intention.",
  "Then one day, they vanished.",
  "Not destroyed. Not defeated. Gone, as though they stepped behind the veil they once controlled.",
  "The world remained incomplete — left to decay, glitch, regenerate, and rewrite itself endlessly. Biomes shifted unnaturally. Structures appeared where no builder existed. Something was… unfinished.",
  "When you spawned here, the world reacted.",
  "Paths formed where you walked. Caves opened where you mined. The land began to reshape around your decisions.",
  "As if the BangForge itself had chosen you.",
  "But power never comes without consequence.",
  "Whispers say the Forge remembers the mistakes of past builders. It watches from the unseen. It tests those who touch its power.",
  "Every creation strengthens the world. Every destruction awakens something beneath it.",
  "BangForge is not just a realm.",
  "It is a forge. And you — are the newest Hammer.",
  "Build with intention. Shape with purpose. The world listens.",
  "Welcome to BangForge. Where creation has consequences."
